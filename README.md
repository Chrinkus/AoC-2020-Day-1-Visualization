# Advent of Code 2020 Day 1 Visualization

Created using FLTK and C++.
- My first AoC Visualization
- The code is spaghetti-ish
- FLTK uses a lot of naked 'new's, be warned
- Getting the tree right was the hardest part
- I wish I knew how to make parts of the tree glow..

Requires FLTK 1.3.5 installed via CMake using all defaults
- builds/runs on Windows
- builds/runs on MacOS
